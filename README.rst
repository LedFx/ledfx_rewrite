What is LedFx? Music to Light!
------------------------------

LedFx makes a live light show from your music, creating a more immersive experience for you.

LedFx is written for LED strips, but can also work with bulbs and LED panels.

A cut above the rest
--------------------

Off-the-shelf music reactive LED strips have poor quality microphones and lazy music processing algorithms. The result is jerky and uncomfortable lighting that doesn't match the atmosphere of your music.

The other option is to pre-program your lights for your music, like a concert. This requires a lot of effort to get good looking results.

LedFx solves both of these issues, performing tonal and rhythmic analysis on your music before it even leaves your speakers. The result is an effortlessly stunning light show for you to enjoy.
